# surfs_up_challenge

Using SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks to conduct weather analysis. 

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze a weather condition dataset stored in a SQLite database to unconver any trends that can provide information on whether a Surf n Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii, is worth opening and investing in. It is critical to determine consistent weather conditions throughout the year, specifically looking at June and December, because the business depends on good climate - meaning sunny and warm weather is pivotal for success. To secure the invest, statistical analysis must be conducted so that they can convinced it will be a successful business venture.

This assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. This will be accomplished by inspecting the data in the SQLite databas and using SQLAlchemy to connect and generate queries. This will import the necessary data needed for our analysis. Jupiter notebook is also to import dependencies and create the commands to pull the data from the SQLite database. 

1. Determining the Summary Statistics for June
2. Determining the Summary Statistics for December
3. Writing a report for the statistical analysis

## Results

Weather in June:

In the image below, we see the code that was written in order to retrieve the weather stats. Dependencies were imported and functions were created to connection to the SQLite database.
